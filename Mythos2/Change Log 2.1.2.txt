# Bloodlines
############

- With Holy Fury, the Blood of the Gods trait has been replaced with Blood of the Gods bloodlines
- Different gods will have different bloodlines
- Blood of the Gods bloodlines are passed on to only biological children, including bastards, even if they are unacknowledged
- Blood of the Gods may not always be passed on to children, especially if only one parent has a divine bloodline or the the children is further from divinity
- Characters can only have a single divine bloodline, with more specific bloodlines, such as "Blood of Zeus" taking precidence over more generic ones, like "Blood of Olympus"
- Currently, only the Germanic and Greco-Roman pantheons have god- or pantheon-specific bloodlines. Others will use a generic "Blood of the Gods" bloodline type.
- Characters with certain divine bloodlines are more likely to pick appropriate focuses
- Characters with bloodlines from gods known for chastity are harder to seduce
- AI characters, especially gods, that have certain bloodlines may seduce outside of their court

# Religion
##########

- Religious reformation now adds all characters of that religion with the god trait to their list of gods
- Mythos religions now exclude certain gods if reforming with Domatic, Patriarichal, or Matriarichal
- Religions with ancestor veneration now consider religion-specific virtues and vices
- The Sapphire Flame starts off in existance when Draconic Paganism Reforms
- Instead of granting a holy site to create the Sapphire Flame, reformed draconic pagans can grant a holy site to an unlanded Sapphire Flame
- If the character granting the holy site is an emperor, the Sapphire Flame will become their vassal. Otherwise, it will become independant
- Removed decisions to borrow money or request claims from the Sapphire Flame, as they are redundant with the same ability added in 3.0
- Removed decision to grant the Sapphire Flame land in exchange for an alliance
