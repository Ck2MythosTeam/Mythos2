# Magic
#######
- A new inheritable trait, given to anyone with a magic education will now allow children to be trained in magic even if they could not learn otherwise

#########
# Balance
#########
- AI Vampires should feed less often, especially if there are few human courtiers left
- Automatic Vampire feeding catching a vampire, werewolf, zombie, demon, or ethereal no longer gives healing or stat boosts
- The TOG Faeroyar start now starts with a 15 year non-aggression pact with Haraldr of Norway to stop them from immediately getting conquered
- AI should educate their children a bit less randomly

##########
# Bugfixes
##########
- Anti-monster revolts no longer consider a single wrong-culture/religion province to be equally disasterous as an entire wrong-culture/religion empire
- Satanists no longer try to simultaniously use their own virtues and Christian virtues
- Dragons can now be mages
- Custom characters with magic education should no longer spontaniously lose their education
- Characters should no longer end up with multiple blood court titles
- Fixed Brew potion requiring the target to know magic
- Fixed summoning servants only working for Counts
