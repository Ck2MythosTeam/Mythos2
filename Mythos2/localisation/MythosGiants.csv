EVTDESC_GIANT.2;As my age grows, so does my height and strength.  I tower above the humans around me.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.2;I feel strong
EVTDESC_GIANT.5;As I've listened to people, it seems that being a giant means a lot more than just being bigger than everyone else - it sounds like we have our own traditions and ways of doing things.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.5;I want to find out more.
EVTOPTB_GIANT.5;I'd rather try to fit in.
EVTDESC_GIANT.6;My [GetRootFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has begun asking about the cultures and traditions of the Jotunn.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.6;[From.GetSheHeCap] should learn of [From.GetHerHis] heritage.
EVTOPTB_GIANT.6;Those brutes have no culture.
EVTDESC_GIANT.7;[From.GetTitledName] heard about my interest in giant culture and has begun teaching me about our ancient traditions.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.7;This is really interesting.
EVTDESC_GIANT.8;As I've talked with [From.GetTitledName], it sounds more and more like I was wrong about the giants.  We didn't have any real traditions of our own, just what we stole from neighboring cultures.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.8;That's disappointing.
EVTDESC_GIANT.11;As I listen to legends, people have spoken of gods of giants, like Surtr and Mimir, who are known for their strength and cleverness.  It seems weird that such powerful gods would be treated as villains instead of praised.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.11;I want to learn more about them.
EVTOPTB_GIANT.11;Well, I guess they do hurt humans sometimes.
EVTDESC_GIANT.12;My [GetRootFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has begun asking about the Jotnar gods and begun to question why they are not worshipped.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.12;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] should worship the gods of [From.GetHerHis] people.
EVTOPTB_GIANT.12;[From.GetSheHeCap] should not be worshiping foreign gods.
EVTOPTC_GIANT.12;Worshiping Surtr will only hasten Ragnarok.
EVTOPTD_GIANT.12;[From.GetSheHeCap] should learn the local ways and worship the gods of this land.
EVTDESC_GIANT.13;[From.GetTitledName] has agreed to teach me about the rites and sagas of the Jotnar gods.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.13;I'll learn all of them.
EVTDESC_GIANT.14;[From.GetTitledName] is being very strict and mean.  [From.GetSheHeCap] won't let me listen to or read anything about the giant gods anymore.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.14;I guess I'll have to find other hobbies.
