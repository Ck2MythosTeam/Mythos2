EVTDESC_GIANT.2;As my age grows, so does my height and strength.  I tower above the humans around me.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.2;I feel strong
EVTDESC_GIANT.5;As I've listened to people, it seems that being a giant means a lot more than just being bigger than everyone else - it sounds like we have our own traditions and ways of doing things.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.5;I want to find out more.
EVTOPTB_GIANT.5;I'd rather try to fit in.
EVTDESC_GIANT.6;My [GetRootFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], has begun asking about the cultures and traditions of the Jotunn.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.6;[From.GetSheHeCap] should learn of [From.GetHerHis] heritage.
EVTOPTB_GIANT.6;Those brutes have no culture.
EVTDESC_GIANT.7;[From.GetTitledName] heard about my interest in giant culture and has begun teaching me about our ancient traditions.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.7;This is really interesting.
EVTDESC_GIANT.8;As I've talked with [From.GetTitledName], it sounds more and more like I was wrong about the giants.  We didn't have any real traditions of our own, just what we stole from neighboring cultures.
EVTOPTA_GIANT.8;That's disappointing.
